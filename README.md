# Assignment 4 Instructions

Steps to take to test for Assignment 4:
  
1. We will need to whitelist your IP address to ensure that you are able to test the user service and question service backends as we used a cloud database with mandatory IP whitelisting for this assignment. Please contact one of us with your IP address in advance in order to access the database:
  - Branson Lam @Bransonlj (telegram) Bransonlj@gmail.com (email)
  - Ang Yuze @angyuze (telegram) angyuze6@gmail.com (email)
  - Please note to not use NUS School wifi while testing due to some IP restrictions.

## Docker:
- Ensure that docker is installed and running on your computer
- In the terminal, enter the command `docker compose up` from the main directory
- The respective frontend and backend images will be built and their containers will start running
- Go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the frontend and test the question and user services
