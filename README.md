Steps to take to test for Assignment 3:
1. Pull the branch on this repo titled Assignment-3-branch
2. We will need to whitelist your IP address to ensure that you are able to test the user service and question service backends as we used a cloud database with mandatory IP whitelisting for this assignment. Please contact one of us with your IP address in advance in order to access the database:
  - Branson Lam @Bransonlj (telegram) Bransonlj@gmail.com (email)
  - Ang Yuze @angyuze (telegram) angyuze6@gmail.com (email)
  - Please note to not use NUS School wifi while testing due to some IP restrictions.

## Backend
- For both the question service and user service backends, add the .env file, which is the submitted text file on canvas called Assignment3.txt.
- For the question service and user service in the backend directory, type `yarn` in the command line. Do this also for the frontend directory.
- Next type `yarn run dev` in the terminal in the user service directory and question service directory. 

## Frontend
- In the terminal, cd to the `frontend` directory, and type `yarn`.
- Next type `yarn run dev` in the terminal in this same directory.
